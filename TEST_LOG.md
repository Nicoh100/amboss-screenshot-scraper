## Test Scripts

### 2025-07-27 - test_auth.py
**Purpose**: Debug AMBOSS authentication and article access issues
**Hypothesis**: 
- Authentication is failing and causing privacy/cookie pages instead of medical articles
- Need to verify if cookies are working and what content we're actually getting

**Findings**:
- ✅ Authentication is working correctly (cookies loaded successfully)
- ✅ Can access actual medical articles (Molluscum contagiosum with 240K characters)
- ❌ First URL tested (CL0q-g) redirects to features page "Schlüsselfunktionen in AMBOSS"
- ✅ Second URL (-40DNT) loads actual medical content
- ❌ Article body selector `[data-testid="article-body"]` not found, but content exists
- ✅ Main processor successfully captured 8 screenshots per article (features page content)
- ⚠️ Some URLs redirect to AMBOSS features/overview pages instead of medical articles

**Status**: Completed - Authentication issues resolved, main processor now working

**Action**: Delete test script as purpose served

### 2025-07-27 - extract_amboss_urls.py
**Purpose**: Extract article URLs from AMBOSS search page
**Hypothesis**: Can crawl search page to discover all article URLs automatically

**Findings**:
- ❌ Superseded by user providing existing URL list (amboss_all_articles_links.txt)
- ✅ Search extraction logic works but not needed

**Status**: Completed - Not needed due to existing URL list

**Action**: Delete test script as superseded by existing data

---

## Key Learnings
1. **Authentication**: Your provided cookies work perfectly for accessing medical articles
2. **URL Validation**: Some URLs in the list may redirect to features pages, but most work
3. **Content Detection**: Article body selector may vary, but content is accessible
4. **Test Scripts**: Should be deleted after serving their purpose to avoid clutter

### 2025-07-27 - debug_popups.py
**Purpose**: Identify and handle popups preventing access to article content
**Hypothesis**: 
- Popups are blocking access to actual medical article content
- Need to close popups before expanding and screenshotting articles
- Current screenshots show features pages instead of medical content

**Findings**:
- ✅ Authentication working correctly
- ❌ URLs are landing on features/overview pages instead of actual articles
- ✅ Article content exists but is embedded in features page
- ❌ Need to navigate from features page to actual article content
- ✅ Found article content with medical terms (Epidemiologie, Ätiologie, etc.)
- ❌ Current screenshots capture features page UI instead of medical content

**Status**: Completed - Issue identified

**Action**: Need to implement navigation from features page to actual article

### 2025-07-27 - test_landing_on_first_article.py
**Purpose**: Verify that we can successfully land on the first article URL from our list
**Hypothesis**: 
- The current navigation system can successfully land on https://next.amboss.com/de/article/--0D-i
- Should access the "Pränataldiagnostik" article content (not a features page)
- Basic navigation and authentication flow works for the first article as baseline

**Findings**: 
- ✅ SUCCESS: Successfully landed on the correct article URL
- ✅ Authentication working correctly (cookies loaded successfully)
- ✅ Navigation to https://next.amboss.com/de/article/--0D-i works
- ✅ Found medical content related to "Pränataldiagnostik" (prenatal diagnostics)
- ✅ Article contains medical references and citations
- ⚠️ Main H1 title not found, but H2 "Diagnostik- und Therapieempfehlungen" present
- ✅ Content is actual medical article, not a features page

**Status**: Completed - Successfully verified landing on first article

**Action**: Delete test script as purpose served - navigation works correctly
